# Lessons learned

+ time needed for first construction: ~40h (another assemblies can be shorten to ~24h)

+ good quality/price ration

+ good for prototyping

+ great software (web page) for controlling printer

+ good model for learning

- assembly of drive belt for axis (easy to fit but doesn't seem too reliable)
